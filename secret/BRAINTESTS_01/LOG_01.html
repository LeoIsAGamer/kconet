  <h1>LOG 01 - NOV 12th 12:35AM</h1>
    <p>We screwed up. BrianCO was a ploy, it was a sience company called BrainCO.</p>
    <p>They began work on 'making a realistic AI' for BR+. I'll tell you what they</p>
    <p>were actually doing. Stuffing peoples brains inside of game cartridges. That</p>
    <p>is the reason i initiated this initiative. We will try to give the people in</p>
    <p>those cartridges back there bodies!</p>
    <p>Leo Kylilis, CEO OF KCO, NOV 12</p>
